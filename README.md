# Collecting Data




- Repository: `challenge-collecting-data`
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation`
- Duration: `3 days`
- Deadline: `25/09/2020 17:00`
- Team challenge : 3


## Mission objectives 
Use a python library to collect as much data as possible.

At the end of this challenge, you should :

- Be able to scrape a website
- Be able to build a dataset from scratch
- Be able to Implement a strategy to collect as much data as possible.

## The Mission
The real estate company "ImmoEliza" wants to create a machine learning model to make price predictions on real estate sales in Belgium. You must therefore create a dataset that holds the following columns :

- Locality
- Type of property (House/apartment)
- Subtype of property (Bungalow, Chalet, Mansion, ...)
- Price
- Type of sale (Exclusion of life sales)
- Number of rooms
- Area
- Fully equipped kitchen (Yes/No)
- Furnished (Yes/No)
- Open fire (Yes/No)
- Terrace (Yes/No) 
    - If yes: Area
- Garden (Yes/No)
   - If yes: Area
- Surface of the land
- Surface area of the plot of land
- Number of facades
- Swimming pool (Yes/No)
- State of the building (New, to be renovated, ...)

You must save everything in a csv file.


### Must-have features
- Data for all of Belgium.
- Minimum 10 000 inputs
- No empty row. If you are missing information, set the value to None.

### Miscellanous information
   Be careful not to have duplicates. The dataset must be clean. Try as much as possible to record only numerical values.  Example: Instead of defining whether the kitchen is equipped with a "Yes", use binary values. 

## Deliverables
1. Publish your source code on a GitHub repository.
2. Pimp up the README file:
   - Description
   - Installation
   - Usage
   - (Visuals)
   - (Contributors)
   - (Timeline)
   - (Personal situation)
3. Small presentation :
	- How you did it ?
	- Who did what ?
	- What went wrong ?
	- How you solved it ?

### Steps
1. Create the repository
2. Study the request (What & Why ?)
3. Identify technical challenges (How ?)

|                | Minimize non-numeric values.                                                          |        |



## A final note of encouragement
Attempts to create thinking machines will be a great help in discovering how we think ourselves.
